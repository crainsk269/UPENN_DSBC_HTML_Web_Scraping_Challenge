## UPENN_DSBC_HTML_Web_Scraping_Challenge

##### For this challenge, I referred to the class material as well as re-watched the course lectures. In addition, I used such websites as Python Docs, Stackoverflow, W3Schools, and Geeks for Geeks. I also needed to refresh myself with matplotlib. Overall, it was a good challenge.
